# Learning Objectives

## Topic: Basic Operators (plus, minus, multiply, divide, modulo)

1. **Understand Arithmetic Operators:** Explain the purpose and usage of basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %) in programming.

2. **Perform Arithmetic Operations:** Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus operations on numeric values.

## Topic: Strings and Template Literals

3. **String Manipulation:** Demonstrate how to create, concatenate, and manipulate strings in a programming language.

4. **Template Literals:** Understand and use template literals (also known as template strings) for string interpolation and multiline strings.

## Topic: Equality Operators (=== & ==)

5. **Comparison Operators:** Differentiate between strict equality (===) and loose equality (==) operators, explaining their behavior and use cases.

6. **Equality vs. Identity:** Understand the difference between equality (comparing values) and identity (comparing types and values) in relation to these operators.

## Topic: Logical Operators (!, &&, and ||)

7. **Logical Operators:** Explain the purpose and usage of logical operators (! for NOT, && for AND, || for OR) to manipulate Boolean values.

8. **Truth Tables:** Construct and interpret truth tables to evaluate logical expressions involving these operators.

## Topic: Ternary Operator

9. **Ternary Conditional Operator:** Describe the ternary operator (conditional operator) and how it provides a concise way to write conditional statements.

10. **Ternary Usage:** Implement conditional expressions using the ternary operator for simpler decision-making in code.
